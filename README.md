# IntentTP-android

This repository contains a simple Android application demonstrating the usage of Intents in Android development. It's part of an academic exercise to understand how Intents work for navigating between activities.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:

1. `MainActivity`: The main activity of the app, which contains a button to navigate to TestActivity.
2. `TestActivity`: A secondary activity that can be navigated back to MainActivity.

## Features

- Navigate from MainActivity to TestActivity using an Intent
- Navigate from TestActivity back to MainActivity using an Intent
- Demonstration of basic activity lifecycle and navigation

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
4. On the main screen, click the "Go" button to navigate to TestActivity.
5. On the test screen, click the button to navigate back to MainActivity.

## Code Structure

- `MainActivity.java`: Contains the logic for the main screen and navigation to TestActivity.
- `TestActivity.java`: Contains the logic for the test screen and navigation back to MainActivity.
- `activity_main.xml`: Layout file for the main activity (not included in the provided code snippet).
- `test.xml`: Layout file for the test activity (not included in the provided code snippet).

## Learning Objectives

This project helps in understanding:

- How to create and use Intents in Android
- Navigation between different activities
- Basic Android UI components (Buttons)
- Handling click events in Android

## Note

This is an academic exercise and is intended for learning purposes. It demonstrates basic Intent functionality and may not include all best practices for production-level applications.
